  "description": "Hello, my name is Drew Tekulve. I am a Colorist residing in Utah with experience in everything from TV shows and commercials, to feature films that screened at Sundance Film Festival. I work primarily in DaVinci Resolve, with experience in HDR, ACES, and digital intermediate workflows.  As a Utah Resolve Colorist, I’ve had unique opportunities to work with a variety of clients. Musical Artists like The Killers, Imagine Dragons, Kaskade, and others have used my color grade services in music videos. Likewise, I’ve worked with major brands like Purple Mattress, Verizon, Vivint, Wells Fargo, and Podium. Local connections offer a lot of opportunity for a Utah Resolve colorist, but I’m always looking for chances to branch out.  Whether you’re looking for a Utah Resolve colorist or a remote colorist, I can help bring out the best in your content. Commercials, independent films, music videos, documentaries, YouTube videos—whatever you have in video production can be improved with color correction. I've worked with Musical Artists like The Killers, Imagine Dragons, and Kaskade, along with brands like Purple Mattress, Verizon, Wells Fargo, Vivint, and Podium",
